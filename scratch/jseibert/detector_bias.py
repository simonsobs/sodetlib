def find_bias(iv_fp,band,channels):

    """
    Replaces the pysmurf run_iv function to be more appropriate for SO-specific
    usage, as well as easier to edit as needed.  Steps the TES bias down
    slowly. Starts at bias_high to bias_low with step size bias_step. Waits
    wait_time between changing steps. After overbiasing, can choose bias point
    to allow system to cool down.

    Args
    ----
    iv_fp : str, required
        filepath to the analyzed IV dict you would like to use
    band: int, required
        band that the channels you would like to analyze are on
    channels: numpy.ndarray or list, required, defaults to all channels in IV dict
        channels you would like to analyze. If None, defaults to all channels 
        in the IV dict
    
    Returns
    -------
    good_volt : list
        List of bias voltages that will place the maximal number of detectors
        in the acceptable Rfrac range. 
    s_i: dict
        Dictionary keyed by channel of the responsivities at each of the bias
        voltages returned in good_volt.
